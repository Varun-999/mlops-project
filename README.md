Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```


### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```


## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.

## üßê About <a name="about"></a>

This repository provides a robust MLOps workflow for UrbanSound8K audio classification. The pipeline covers:

- Dataset preprocessing
- CNN model training
- Artifact logging (MLflow)
- Inference API (FastAPI)
- Containerization (Docker)
- Data versioning (DVC)
- CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions)

All steps are containerized for reproducibility and easy deployment.

---

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name="getting_started"></a>

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- pip
- Docker & Docker Compose
- UrbanSound8K dataset (CSV metadata and audio folders)
- (Optional) Google Drive credentials for DVC pull

---

## üîß Installation <a name="installation"></a>

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Place UrbanSound8K dataset and metadata CSV in the appropriate `dataset/` directory.
3. Copy provided `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` templates.
4. Build and start all services (API, MLflow server, training jobs):

    ```sh
    docker compose up --build
    ```

5. Pull DVC-managed data (if needed):

    ```sh
    dvc pull -v data/urbansound8k/fold1.dvc
    ```

6. Access the API documentation at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) after containers start.

---

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

- **Train a new CNN model:**

    ```sh
    python src/train.py
    ```

- **Serve the prediction API:**

    ```sh
    uvicorn src.main:app --reload
    ```

- **Predict sound class from a local file:**

    ```sh
    python src/predict.py --file path/to/audio.wav
    ```

All model artifacts required for deployment are logged by MLflow and loaded at service start.

---

## üöÄ Deployment <a name="deployment"></a>

For live deployment, use the provided `docker-compose.yml`:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

This starts:

- MLflow tracking server
- FastAPI audio classification service
- Dedicated training job container

Host volumes are used for model artifacts, DVC-managed data, and MLflow runs, ensuring reproducibility and persistence.

---

## üîß Running the tests <a name="tests"></a>

To run automated pipeline tests:

```sh
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print('TensorFlow version:', tf.__version__)"
docker compose run --rm train-job
```

For code style checks (manual addition recommended):

```sh
flake8 .
```
